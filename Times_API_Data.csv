"1","2022-04-18","By Brett Anderson","RICHMOND, Va. — Hamidullah Noori was 8 years old when his father, uncle and cousin were killed by Taliban militants in Kabul, Afghanistan. As the eldest son, he soon went to work to support his family, selling boiled potatoes and balloons from a pushcart. Violence and flight have shaped his life ever since.So as he follows news reports about the Russian assault on Ukraine, Mr. Noori feels a weary kinship with the refugees fleeing that conflict, knowing that their futures will resemble his past.“This is something where I have already experienced it,” he said, sitting in his Richmond restaurant, the Mantu. “If you’re lucky, you survive.”When Mr. Noori opened the Mantu in 2019, four years after arriving in Virginia as a refugee, he joined a group of restaurateurs who had already established a solid presence for Afghan cuisine in the District of Columbia, Maryland and Virginia. The region is home to one of the largest populations of resettled Afghans in the United States — more than 16,000 came to the area during the 20-year war that ended last year, an influx second only to California’s, according to U.S. News & World Report.These restaurants represent generations who have fled wars since the 1970s, and the cuisine of a region that has been interconnected with the rest of the world for centuries, owing to its location at the nexus of the ancient Silk Road trade route.The withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan last August, which ended the conflict and led to the Taliban’s swift takeover of the government, compelled many Afghan restaurateurs in Maryland, Virginia and the District of Columbia to come to the aid of the refugees who soon started pouring into the area. One by one, the restaurants have taken it on themselves to cook for the new arrivals, raise money to help them resettle and provide them jobs. The Mantu’s 10 employees are all Afghan refugees.On a single day last fall, Mr. Noori cooked nearly 3,000 meals for refugees at a local military base. He has since set a goal of feeding every Afghan family resettling in Richmond their first meal in the United States.Mr. Noori, 36, a member of Richmond’s Ismaili Muslim community, said he draws strength from helping people who have every right to be fearful.“When you have the courage to gain something, you’ll gain it,” he said. “The universe will be at your service.”The resurgence of the Taliban has threatened the return of its past brutality and repression, particularly of women. And the war in Ukraine is a fresh reminder of Afghanistan’s long history of upheaval.Reporting From AfghanistanInside the Fall of Kabul: ​The Taliban took the Afghan capital with a speed that shocked the world. Our reporter and photographer witnessed it.On Patrol: A group of Times journalists spent 12 days with a Taliban police unit in Kabul. Here is what they saw.Face to Face: ​​A Times reporter who served as a Marine in Afghanistan returned to interview a Taliban commander he once fought.A Photographer’s Journal: A look at 20 years of war in Afghanistan, chronicled through one Times photographer’s lens.Shamim Popal wept as she recalled her escape from Kabul with her three young children — including her 6-month-old daughter, Fatima — in 1980, after the Soviet Union invaded. She left behind her ailing father, who died soon after, to join her husband, Zubair, in Bahrain.“What we see now, it really reminds us of the days that we left,” Ms. Popal, 67, said in early March, in the basement dining room of Lapis, her family’s Afghan restaurant in Washington. “It’s so sad.”The couple sat with Fatima, now 42, and one of their sons, Omar, 43 — all of them business partners who opened their first restaurant in the early 2000s. They considered serving their native cuisine, but ultimately decided to open a French restaurant instead.“It was too close to 9/11,” Fatima said. “People were still very stereotypical about terrorists and Afghanistan.”Such concerns had ebbed by the time Lapis opened in 2015, when Afghan restaurants were flourishing, both locally and globally.Last August, as Afghan refugees began surging into the United States, the Popals solicited donations of clothes, toiletries and other essentials on the restaurant’s social media accounts.The overwhelming response turned Lapis into a makeshift distribution center. The donations allowed the Popals to support refugees as humanitarian groups scrambled to provide aid to the new arrivals. More than 76,000 Afghans have resettled in the United States since last August.“We had no walking space,” Fatima said. “We were still an open business.”An enlarged, framed version of Shamim’s passport photograph from the day she left Afghanistan hangs in the restaurant’s main dining room, among many other photos that evoke happier times in Kabul, before the Soviets invaded.“We wanted to give people a slice of my parents’ life,” Omar said, “before you have this loss of the culture.”In a 2020 cookbook, “Parwana,” Durkhanai Ayubi, whose family runs a restaurant of the same name outside Adelaide, Australia, writes that cooking after leaving Afghanistan in the late 1980s became a way for her mother, Farida Ayubi, the restaurant’s chef, “to stay connected with what was being suppressed and at risk of being lost.”The book is a sweeping history of a cuisine — distinguished by what Ms. Ayubi calls “warm spices” like cumin, cardamom, cinnamon and turmeric — that has cross-pollinated with the cooking of India, China, Mongolia, Turkey and Persia.The Afghan restaurants in  Maryland, Virginia and the District of Columbia, most of which are clustered in metropolitan Washington and Baltimore, share similar dishes — sabzi, aushak, Kabuli palaw — but their personalities are as different as their origins.The Helmand, in Baltimore, is an elder in the group: Baltimoreans have been eating platters of dopiaza and lamb chops on its white tablecloths since 1989. Qayum Karzai, who owns the restaurant with his wife, Pat, can still be found seating guests on weekends.Mr. Karzai, 74, is the brother of the former Afghan president Hamid Karzai, who appointed him to that country’s parliament. Qayum Karzai resigned his seat in 2008, and later mounted a short-lived campaign to succeed his brother. The family has been hugely influential and controversial in Afghanistan, where its political connections helped members amass wealth.Qayum Karzai was exposed to American politics in the 1970s, while working as a young waiter at the Devil’s Fork, a power-dining destination in Washington. “The meetings that these senators had, from both parties,” he recalled, “they acted like members from the same family.”Three miles from the Helmand, in the Hampden neighborhood of Baltimore, Afghan restaurants are on the rise. During a recent lunch at Spring Cafe, diners quietly served themselves chainaki, an Afghan stew, from teapots, delivered with side dishes of sliced daikon and serrano chile.Hamasa Ebadi, 27, and her parents, Hamida, 58, and Atiq, 60, opened the tiny restaurant in the fall of 2020, inside a former bubble-tea shop. And Assad Akbari, the former longtime general manager and chef at the Helmand, has announced plans to open his own Afghan restaurant this year, on the same street.Ms. Ebadi said she came to the United States in 2010 for high school. “I wanted to continue my education, and under the Taliban, women simply weren’t allowed to,” she said. Today, Ms. Ebadi commutes between Baltimore and Dallas, where she works as a neuroscience researcher.The Taliban’s return to power, and its continued subjugation of women, prompted one restaurateur, Omar Masroor, to take symbolic action. Last September, Mr. Masroor, 47, stepped away from the operations of his family’s restaurants — Bistro Aracosia in Washington, and Aracosia McLean and Afghan Bistro in Northern Virginia — and promoted two of his daughters, Taliha, 23, and Iman, 22, to management positions.Today, the sisters, together with their mother, Sofia, 46, who oversees the restaurants’ food, largely run the operation — roles that would be denied to them in Afghanistan, where the Taliban grants women little freedom outside the home. The family is planning to open a fourth restaurant, Afghania, in Georgetown, and is training the youngest daughter, Zainab, 21, to be a manager as well. “We feel horrible for the situation for women in Afghanistan,” Sofia said. “For my daughters to know that we’re confident, to know that we believe in them, it gives them that little push to be confident in themselves.” Mr. Noori, the Richmond restaurateur, trained as a chef in Kabul. After his arrival in Virginia, he worked a number of different low-paying jobs, including driving for a ride service.“I printed up a card: Chef Noori, Catering, Afghani Food,” he said. “I was always talking about my restaurant dream to people.”The networking led Mr. Noori to Micheal Sparks, the chief executive of the Underground Kitchen, a special-events company that hires and supports chefs from backgrounds that have been underrepresented in Richmond restaurants.The two men met when Mr. Sparks was getting a massage at the house of an employee for the local chapter of the International Rescue Committee, who was moonlighting as a masseuse.“Noori walks in, looking like the prime minister of Canada,” Mr. Sparks recalled. “The first thing out of his mouth after I tell him about Underground Kitchen is, ‘How much are you going to pay me?’”Mr. Noori’s meals with the Underground Kitchen featured dishes that are now signatures at the Mantu, including various versions of the rice dish palaw; skewered, seasoned ground beef on hot iron platters; and a dish of sautéed potato skins similar to what his mother used to make in Kabul from scraps scavenged from a nearby French fry shop.The chef is particularly proud of his mantu, the dumplings that gave the restaurant its name. “When you fold the dumpling into a rose and you steam them, it blossoms,” he said. “The dish is romantic.”After the Afghan pop-up dinners captured the notice of the local press, Mr. Sparks helped Mr. Noori secure the lease for the Mantu’s location in the city’s Carytown neighborhood. Mr. Noori, Mr. Sparks and Kate Houck, a partner in the Underground Kitchen, designed the restaurant’s space, and have started working on plans for a bakery and food market in a Richmond suburb.The new business will give Mirullah Karimi, an Afghan baker Mr. Noori hired last month, a place to sell his bread, and will create jobs for other Afghans trying to restart their lives. Mr. Noori also plans to open two smaller versions of the Mantu in Richmond.“Coming from another country into America, life is hard,” said Neamatullah Mohammadi, 31, who was an engineer in Afghanistan before Mr. Noori hired him as a manager at the Mantu, even though he didn’t speak English or have any restaurant experience. “Chef Noori helped me here, with a car. He’s even helping me find an engineering job.”In early March, Mr. Noori wore a T-shirt he sells to help raise money for his relief efforts. It reads: Proudly Supporting Afghan Refugees. Two weeks later, he created a similar shirt in support of Ukrainians.“This is what humanity is, to hold each other’s hand when in need,” he said. “Everything else is secondary.”Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and Pinterest.

"2","2022-03-26","By Megan Specia","LONDON — A toddler cries on his mother’s lap while his twin naps a few feet away. The mother hushes their older siblings, who are watching videos on an iPad in the next room.The mother, Seema Mohammed; her husband, Eid Mohammed; and their five children have lived in two adjoining hotel rooms south of London since November after they fled Afghanistan. It is a cramped and claustrophobic existence that feels like limbo while they await permanent housing. But a reminder of what they left behind is only a video call away: Mr. Mohammed’s elder brother, a doctor and former police officer, is in hiding back home and desperately looking for a way out.“It’s a struggle,” Mr. Mohammed said. “Living a life is different than staying alive.” He was referring to the family he left in Afghanistan, but the same sentiment could apply to his current situation.Britain evacuated about 16,000 people from Afghanistan last year, most of them during the chaotic final days of August as the Taliban suddenly seized control of the country. Most of them have been living temporarily in hotels across Britain ever since, a situation that British lawmakers have said is increasingly untenable.In February, the government said that just 4,000 Afghans brought to Britain during the mass evacuation had been moved into homes — leaving 12,000 still housed temporarily in hotels.With a new and even larger refugee crisis exploding much closer to home now, officials are talking about taking in tens of thousands more refugees from the war in Ukraine. But the experience of Afghans has raised questions about whether the country can cope with much larger numbers when it has still not managed to settle thousands of Afghans many months after they arrived.The government has offered a number of reasons for the inability to find permanent homes for the Afghan evacuees, key among them a shortage of affordable housing across the country. But critics of the government say the situation is also a result of inept planning, a lack of will and even a hostility toward asylum seekers and migrants in general.“There is a xenophobic attitude underpinning immigration and asylum policy in the U.K.,” said Steve Valdez-Symonds, the refugee and migrant rights program director for Amnesty U.K.This criticism has been echoed with regards to the British government response to the refugee crisis created by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which has driven millions of people from their homes. Much of Europe has allowed the refugees to enter without visas, but Britain has required visas and an application process that is confusing many and slowing their arrival.When asked about the delays in housing Afghan evacuees, the government said that there was still no deadline to find permanent housing for all of them, and that it was matching people with accommodation as quickly as possible.Most of those evacuated had worked in Afghanistan for the British military or government and fled with little more than the clothes on their backs, traumatized by their experiences.Large families are now crowded into small rooms where they cannot cook their own food, and they do not know where or when they will be given a permanent home. Many said they felt eager but unable to restart their lives.Despite the difficult circumstances, most Afghan refugees in Britain say they are deeply grateful for the chance at a safe future, with stable housing, ample food and access to medical care.Still, Becky Brook, a volunteer with Kensington and Chelsea Mutual Aid, a community group supporting refugees in West London, said the situation was not sustainable. Families are increasingly desperate to move on, among other reasons, because it is difficult for them to find work if they do not know where they will be living.“Being in hotels long term is not healthy for anybody,” she said.For Khalil Motawakel, 37, who was evacuated from Afghanistan in August, having a permanent home near London, where he has managed to find a job, would mean independence and security. As a former government minister, he was once responsible for overhauling Afghanistan’s troubled prison system.When it became clear that the Taliban were going to retake the country and free its supporters from prison, he knew he would be a target.Live Updates: Russia-Ukraine WarUpdated May 24, 2022, 8:03 a.m. ETEurope is working around Russian ‘blackmail’ to get grain from Ukraine to the world, a top official says.Here are the latest developments in the war in Ukraine.Russia and China held a military exercise in East Asia as Biden visited, the first since the Ukraine invasion.“Our lives were under deadly threat,” he said.Mr. Motawakel, who earned a graduate degree in public policy at the University of Bristol in England, said he had dedicated his entire adult life to strengthening democratic systems in Afghanistan and never thought he would be forced to leave.When he arrived in England in August, he was keen to immediately restart his life, and by November, he had found a job at an international public relations firm. Now, he commutes a few days a week to an office in London from his temporary home in a hotel an hour north of the city, where he lives with his wife and small child.While they have all of the essentials, and he is grateful for the support, he is eager for permanence.“You’d like to take some kind of ownership over your life,” he said. “It’s about the freedom of choice.”Organizations that support refugees say the government system for absorbing migrants is flawed and underfunded. The Local Government Association, which represents local councils tasked with ensuring that the needs of Afghan families are met, has asked the government for better funding and coordination.Last month, the government asked private landlords to register available properties on a relaunched housing portal. But the government’s reluctance to pay market value for properties leaves limited options, said Leyla Williams, the deputy director of West London Welcome, a charity aiding refugees and asylum seekers.She said the government’s failure to secure long-term housing was a problem for other asylum seekers long before Afghan refugees arrived last year. Some 25,000 asylum seekers from different countries, in addition to the Afghan evacuees, are also housed in hotels, the government said in February.Charities and veterans have often stepped in to fill the gaps left by government programs.Matt Simmons, a veteran stationed in Afghanistan with the British Royal Air Force in the early 2000s, set up Ems4Afghans, a community aid group in southern England that provides support to the refugees still in hotels.“It’s going to be a long road,” he said. “Naïvely, everyone thought when they first arrived that by December, everyone would be in houses soon.”Mr. Simmons has helped a number of refugees, including Mr. Mohammed, who praised him and other American and British former colleagues for their support.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 4Zelensky urges an even harder line. Speaking by video to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine called on world powers to go much further to punish Moscow. Russia, usually a major presence at the gathering, was a pariah this year.War crimes trial. Judges in Kyiv handed down the first guilty verdict against a Russian soldier tried for war crimes. Sgt. Vadim Shishimarin, who had pleaded guilty last week, was sentenced to life in prison for killing a 62-year-old civilian.Powerful U.S. artillery arrives. American-made M777 howitzers — the most lethal weapons the West has provided to Ukraine so far — are now deployed in combat in Ukraine’s east. Their arrival has buoyed Ukraine’s hopes of achieving artillery superiority at least in some frontline areas.Biden visits Asia. At a news conference during a visit to Tokyo, President Biden suggested that he would be willing to go further on behalf of Taiwan than he has in helping Ukraine. Mr. Biden indicated that he would use military force to defend Taiwan if it were ever attacked by China.Mr. Mohammed had worked as a translator for British and American military forces and on a series of other internationally funded development projects for years beginning in 2005.Recently, he traveled with his family to Lincoln, England, to visit a cousin. With his children on a school break, the journey was a welcome respite from monotonous hotel life. It was also a chance to share home-cooked meals that they had missed.He described how he had savored one of the meals in particular — a dish made of okra, vegetables and spices — that he had not had since leaving Afghanistan.His children bounced on a trampoline while he spoke on a video call to his elder brother, who is in hiding in Afghanistan, and other family members there. The children leaned forward with wide smiles and waved when their grandmother came on the screen.Mr. Mohammed’s daughter, Sahar, threw her arms around his neck, her dress flowing with each bounce. There is good here, Mr. Mohammed said, grateful to see his children in school and safe.“I can imagine a bright future for my kids now,” he said.Another Afghan refugee, Abdul Sultani, said his family was fortunate to have received permanent housing in November — a small house in northeast London.“I am not here to just sit and watch. I am here to work,” he said of the job he recently started teaching English. He sends some of the money he earns to his family in Afghanistan.Mr. Sultani, 33, worked as a translator with the British and U.S. military. He said his children were beaten by members of the Taliban as they made their way to the airport for their evacuation flight in August.In the living room, his 4-year-old daughter blows bubbles that her younger sister pops, while he picks up a call: the local council offering English classes to his wife.They are the reason he knew he had to leave Afghanistan, he said, and seeing that they have begun rebuilding their lives gives him solace.“Still, it’s not my home. I am just a guest here,” he said. “But I will always act like a guest and try to be useful to them because they helped me.”"
"3","2022-03-24","By Amelia Nierenberg","Good morning. We’re covering global summits about Ukraine, a North Korean missile test and a change in Australia’s refugee policy.Biden’s tough diplomatic movesAfter a day of intense global diplomacy in Brussels, President Biden said Russia should be removed from the Group of 20 nations. If the other member countries do not agree to the expulsion, he said, then Ukraine should be allowed to participate. Between back-to-back summits with NATO, the Group of 7 and the European Union, Biden also pledged to take in 100,000 refugees from Ukraine and donate $1 billion to help European nations handle the surge of displaced Ukrainians.More than three million people have left Ukraine, and a U.N. agency estimates that the war has driven more than half the country’s children from their homes.Economy: The U.S. hit Russia with more sanctions, targeting more than 300 members of its Parliament and dozens of defense companies, in conjunction with new sanctions from Britain. Russia partly reopened its stock market after nearly a month.State of the war:The Times’s Visual Investigations team analyzed dozens of battlefield radio transmissions between Russian forces, revealing logistical problems and communication failures.Russia has all but obliterated everyday civilian life in Ukraine.Ukrainians claimed to have destroyed a Russian landing ship that was supplying forces at a port in Russian-occupied Ukraine.NATO has been rapidly building its military presence in Eastern Europe and agreed on Thursday to provide Ukraine with equipment and training to deal with the possible fallout if Russia turns to unconventional weapons.Other updates:The U.S. overestimated Afghan resistance and underestimated Ukraine. Why can’t its spy agencies predict a country’s will to fight?Russian crew members aboard a superyacht — possibly linked to Vladimir Putin — abruptly left their jobs on Thursday.Afghans are watching the U.S.’s welcoming stance toward Ukrainian refugees with frustration and confusion, wondering what it may mean for them.Denys Karachevtsev, a cellist, played Bach in the ruined streets of Kharkiv, his hometown in Ukraine.World War II killed more than five million Ukrainians, and Russia’s invasion has stirred frightening memories for survivors.North Korea tests an ICBMNorth Korea carried out its boldest weapons test in years and its first intercontinental ballistic missile firing since 2017. The missile on Thursday appeared to be the North’s most powerful ICBM to date, South Korean officials said.Coming just before a NATO meeting over the war in Ukraine, the test drastically escalated tensions with the Biden administration. The U.S., Japan and South Korea quickly condemned the launch, which spurred tit-for-tat missile launches by South Korea.Launch: The missile flew at an extremely steep angle, reaching an altitude of 6,000 kilometers — far higher than in past tests — and covering 1,099 kilometers before it crashed into waters west of Japan 71 minutes after liftoff, Japanese officials said. Questions remain about whether the North could hit another continent.Background: Here’s a look inside the country’s arsenal.Politics: The test comes less than three weeks after the South elected a president who promised a tougher stance on the North.New Zealand resettles offshore refugeesAfter refusing for years, Australia will allow some refugees currently or previously held in its widely criticized offshore detention centers to resettle in New Zealand.Australia’s government has long suggested that the arrangement could encourage more people to make dangerous sea crossings to try to eventually enter Australia — perhaps through New Zealand, where all refugees are put on a path to citizenship.Live Updates: Russia-Ukraine WarUpdated May 25, 2022, 2:52 p.m. ETThe European Union’s proposed oil embargo of Russia is stuck in a standoff.A doomed river crossing shows the perils of entrapment in the war’s east.Hungary’s Viktor Orban declares state of emergency, citing the Ukraine war to expand his power.It was not immediately clear why Australia changed its mind. One refugee coordinator suggested that the length and cost of the detentions had become burdensome.Background: New Zealand first offered the arrangement in 2013, after Australia began holding those arriving by boat on islands, pledging to prevent them from ever settling in the country.Details: New Zealand will take in 150 refugees a year for three years, as part of its total annual refugee quota of 1,500 people. Centers: Australia has detained more than 3,000 refugees and asylum seekers on Manus Island in Papua New Guinea and Nauru, a Pacific island nation, where about 112 people remain.

The biggest trigger of Mei’s panda, to her mother’s dismay, is her passion for 4*Town, a boy band that resembles *NSYNC and BTS. “It’s a side of teen girls that you never get to see,” the film’s director, Domee Shi, told The Times. “We are just as awkward and sweaty and lusty and excited as any boy.”Former and current boy-band fans will see themselves in scenes like the one in which Mei introduces each 4*Town member with a specific fact (“Tae Young fosters injured doves!”) or when Mei and her friends record videos of themselves dancing to the band’s hits (including “Nobody Like U,” written by Billie Eilish and Finneas).With her friends’ help, Mei learns to control her red panda, even harnessing it to raise money to see 4*Town perform.

"4","2022-03-16","By Eileen Sullivan and Miriam Jordan","WASHINGTON — The Biden administration is allowing Afghans who have been residing in the United States to remain in the country legally for at least another 18 months, an attempt to provide them more stability as gaining permanent residency could take years.The benefit, known as temporary protected status, will be extended to more than 74,000 Afghans who were living in the United States as of March 15, according to the Department of Homeland Security, which makes such designations. Most immediately, it will affect roughly 2,000 Afghans who were not among those evacuated during the tumultuous U.S. military pullout from their country last year. Each applicant has to pass a background check.The program does not provide a path to a green card or citizenship, which many advocates say is warranted for Afghans who were brought to the country after risking their lives to assist American forces. Many served as combat interpreters, as drivers and in other supportive roles over the two decades that U.S. troops fought in their country.Most Afghans who were evacuated to the United States last year have already been granted another status, known as humanitarian parole, which allows them to stay for two years. But many have had trouble navigating an immigration system that U.S. officials concede was unprepared to help them. The process to reapply for humanitarian parole after two years can be cumbersome for applicants, but temporary protected status is frequently extended for designated countries by the Department of Homeland Security.Wednesday’s designation appears to be an acknowledgment that it will take years for Afghan evacuees to gain permanent residency through the clogged U.S. immigration system.Reporting From AfghanistanInside the Fall of Kabul: ​The Taliban took the Afghan capital with a speed that shocked the world. Our reporter and photographer witnessed it.On Patrol: A group of Times journalists spent 12 days with a Taliban police unit in Kabul. Here is what they saw.Face to Face: ​​A Times reporter who served as a Marine in Afghanistan returned to interview a Taliban commander he once fought.A Photographer’s Journal: A look at 20 years of war in Afghanistan, chronicled through one Times photographer’s lens.“Our nation’s moral obligation to our Afghan allies and friends demands the stability that only a pathway to permanent residence can provide,” Krish O’Mara Vignarajah, the president of the Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, said on Wednesday.Advocates have lobbied Congress to pass a law, the Afghan Adjustment Act, which would offer Afghans in the United States a fast-track path to permanent residency and citizenship. Some have expressed concern that a temporary status designation, like the one issued on Wednesday, would hurt the chances of the legislation passing.“We are worried that this designation announcement will be conflated with an Afghan Adjustment Act, and people will feel like that is no longer needed,” said Naomi Steinberg, the vice president for policy and advocacy at HIAS, a nonprofit organization that has been helping Afghans resettle in the United States.Among those already in the country, the Homeland Security Department has estimated that about 40 percent will qualify for special immigrant visas because of their work for the United States in Afghanistan. Such visas would enable them to eventually receive a green card and citizenship. However, the abrupt arrival of large numbers of evacuees has created processing backlogs.The temporary status is intended for people from countries that have suffered through natural disasters or other urgent situations, allowing them to live and work in the United States for a specific period, which is often extended.The designation announced on Wednesday does not address the fate of tens of thousands of Afghans — including human rights activists and professional women — who remain in their home country or in neighboring countries, fearing retaliation from a Taliban government that has been searching for people who promoted democratic values or assisted the American military mission.The Biden administration has faced a barrage of criticism over its handling of Afghan refugees; the designation for Afghanistan came only after the administration offered temporary protected status to Ukrainians who were already in the United States.While advocates applauded the designation for Ukraine, which came on the same day Canada and the European Union made similar humanitarian gestures to aid millions of Ukrainians last week, they questioned why the Biden administration has not offered temporary status to people from other war-torn countries, including Cameroon and Ethiopia.Like much in the U.S. immigration system, the temporary protected status program faces its own backlogs. According to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which handles the program, it takes an average of six months to process applications. And even though the announcement for Afghans came on Wednesday, people cannot apply until the government places an official notice in the Federal Register, a process that can take weeks in some cases.“Good policy is going to fall flat if it can’t actually be implemented in a way that allows people to benefit,” said Lisa Parisio, the director of advocacy for Catholic Legal Immigration Network Inc.With Wednesday’s announcement, there are now 13 countries with temporary protected status. At the end of September, there were nearly 300,000 applications pending.More than 400,000 people are currently under the program, including immigrants from El Salvador, Haiti, Sudan, Syria and Venezuela. The protection is granted for six to 18 months, and the Homeland Security Department must extend a country’s designation on a recurring basis. Each time a country is recertified, recipients reapply and pass a security check.Groups that favor limiting immigration have criticized the program, in effect since 1990, for essentially allowing people to remain permanently in the United States. Indeed, many of them have been here for decades.Thousands of Afghans have applied for, and been denied, entry to the United States through humanitarian parole. That status is intended to allow people facing emergencies to gain admission to the country quickly and without a visa, which can take months or years to obtain. Thousands more applicants are still waiting to hear the outcome of their cases while living in danger, according to lawyers representing them.Afghans airlifted during the pullout spent several months on U.S. military bases before being released into communities around the country, where many of them remain in hotels as nonprofit agencies contracted by the government, like Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, HIAS and the International Rescue Committee, try to secure housing for them."
"5","2022-03-08","By Christina Goldbaum, Yaqoob Akbary and Kiana Hayeri","ZARANJ, Afghanistan — The smuggler barreled down the narrow dirt road, bouncing into craters and over rocks that jutted out from the scrubland. His headlights were off and as the car picked up speed, he tightened his grip on the steering wheel trying to wrestle it under his control.It was just after 1 a.m. in this corner of southwest Afghanistan and a full moon drenched the desert dunes a dim, white glow. Hours earlier, the smuggler struck a deal with an Iranian security guard to send 40 Afghans across the nearby border that night.Now a few miles down the road, the migrants hid in a ravine waiting for his signal to run.“I’m coming, I’m near the border, wait a minute!” he screamed into his phone and slammed on the accelerator, kicking up plumes of dust that disappeared into the darkness.It was a typical night’s work for the smuggler, H., who asked to go by only his first initial because of the illegal nature of his business. A broad-shouldered man with a booming voice, H. is one of a handful of kingpins that effectively run Nimruz Province, which abuts the borders with Iran and Pakistan and is the country’s epicenter for all things illegal.For decades, the smuggling trade — of people, drugs and money — has dominated the economy here, flushing cash into an otherwise desolate stretch of Afghanistan where endless desert blends into a washed-out sky. Now, as hundreds of thousands of Afghans try to flee the country, fearing persecution from the Taliban or starvation from the country’s economic collapse, business has boomed for people smugglers like H. who hold the keys to the gate.But as migrants flood into the province, the obstacles that smugglers face have multiplied: Since the former government collapsed, Iran has bolstered its border security while the Taliban have tried to sever the migrant route H. has mastered, one of two migrants use to sneak into Iran.Journalists with The New York Times spent 24 hours with H. to see how the illicit trade that has long run this corner of Afghanistan endures even now.12:45 A.M.“Did the refugees arrive? How many are they?” H. called out to an auto-rickshaw driver who drove past him earlier that night. He nodded at the driver’s response — three migrants — and sped off to collect two young boys he had agreed to send across the border with his cousin before dawn.It was a more frantic night than usual, he explained, owing to a last-minute deal with an Iranian border guard who he promised $35 for each Afghan who crossed the border. That set off a scramble to gather 40 migrants from smuggler-owned hotels in the nearby city, Zaranj, and to bring them to one of H.’s desert safe houses, little more than abandoned-looking mud brick buildings with dirt floors and rusted tin roofs. Now they were converging at a rendezvous point near the border, waiting for the code word — “grapes” — to slip to Iranian security forces on the other side.Reporting From AfghanistanInside the Fall of Kabul: ​The Taliban took the Afghan capital with a speed that shocked the world. Our reporter and photographer witnessed it.On Patrol: A group of Times journalists spent 12 days with a Taliban police unit in Kabul. Here is what they saw.Face to Face: ​​A Times reporter who served as a Marine in Afghanistan returned to interview a Taliban commander he once fought.A Photographer’s Journal: A look at 20 years of war in Afghanistan, chronicled through one Times photographer’s lens.Every step of the operation is at once nerve-racking and familiar, frenzied and meticulously planned, H. explained. Every few minutes, he fielded calls to one of his three phones and shouted instructions to the many accomplices needed to pull off the night’s deal.After the two boys jumped in his car, H. raced back to give the smugglers escorting his group of migrants the all clear and then met his cousin on the side of a winding path nearby, flashing the headlights as he pulled up.“I brought some special refugees,” H. yelled, referring to the young boys whose parents, both addicts, had recently overdosed. H.’s cousin, a suave 26-year-old with one headphone perpetually dangling from his ear, stepped out of his car and into H.’s headlights, grinning.A former soldier in the Afghan National Army, the cousin used to smuggle drugs into Iran — raking in much more than his meager government salary. Once, he bragged, he sneaked 420 kilograms — nearly 1,000 pounds — of opium into Iran without getting caught. When the former government collapsed, he went into people smuggling full-time.Turning around to the young boys in the car, H. told them that the man was their uncle and he would take them across the border to be reunited with other relatives living in Iran. The younger boy, Mustafa, 5, wiped the car’s fogged up window with his sleeve to get a better look at the man. His older brother, Mohsin, 9, was less skeptical.“When I grow up I want to be a smuggler,” he pronounced before hopping out of the car.10:15 A.M.We had agreed to meet H. for lunch the following day and woke up to the sounds of a bustling city. H. had told us about this changing of the guard each dawn, when smugglers slipping across the lunar flatlands return home and the center of life shifts to Zaranj, where buses unload thousands of Afghans each day.Along the main drag, newcomers buy kebabs from street vendors and sit around plastic tables, eager to learn more about the grueling journey ahead. Others peruse shops selling scarves, hats and winter coats — all necessary, the shopkeepers say, to survive the cold desert nights along the migrant trail.Even in the daylight, an aura of paranoia and mistrust permeates Zaranj — a city of liars and thieves, residents say. Nearly everyone who lives here is somehow connected to the smuggling trade from bigwigs like drug runners and arms dealers to informants paid a few dollars a day by men like H. It is the kind of place where people constantly check their rearview mirrors for tails and speak in hushed tones lest the man next to them is listening.As we waited for H. to wake up, we drove down the dusty road to Pakistan alongside pickups packed with migrants headed for the border, their faces swaddled in scarves and goggles to protect from clouds of dust. Within an hour, H. called and chastised us for driving there. Someone — A driver? The kids playing by the stream? The old man collecting kindling? — must have informed him we were there.Twenty minutes later, he met us on the road and told us to follow him to his home on the outskirts of town. We arrived at an opulent three-story house and were led down a winding stairwell to the basement: a spacious room adorned with red carpets, gold trimmed pillars and a large television tuned to an Iranian news channel.“Four of my relatives were kidnapped around the area where you were today,” he warned us as we sat down to eat. Then he lowered his voice: “When we found their bodies, we could only recognize them by their rings.”H. felt safest in the stretch of desert where we drove the night before, land his father owned. He had spent much of his childhood there, taking small boats out along the Helmand River. At 14, he started smuggling small goods — petrol, cash, cigarettes — and accompanying Afghans across the border into Iran.Back then, it was easy, H. explained. Smugglers could pay a small bribe at a border checkpoint and take vans of migrants to Tehran. But around a decade ago, Iran erected a 15-foot-high wall and then, fearing an influx of Afghans after the Taliban seized power, bolstered its security forces at the border.The Taliban too have tried to shut down this route, raiding safe houses and patrolling the desert. Still, smugglers are undeterred. “The Taliban cannot shut down our business. If they tighten security, we will just charge more and get more money,” H. said over lunch. “We’re always one step ahead.”Still, H. admitted, more of his migrants than usual have been deported back to Afghanistan from Iran. Even the two boys he tried to send the night before were ambushed by Iranian soldiers just minutes after they climbed over the border wall.By 3 p.m., the boys had arrived back in Zaranj and H.’s cousin drove them to the house to eat. On the way, he bought them new winter gloves — an apology of sorts for dashing back onto Afghan soil without them the previous night.Sitting among the smugglers, the older brother, Mohsin, recounted the crossing, how he was afraid when he heard gunfire and watched an Iranian soldier beat a migrant. The boys had spent the night in a detention facility on the cold, concrete floor. Without a blanket, Mustafa slept curled up in Mohsin’s arms.“I thought it would be easy to cross the border, but it was too difficult,” Mohsin said matter-of-factly. The smugglers erupted in laughter.H. said he planned to send the boys across the border again that night and told them to rest. Then as dusk settled over the desert, H. began his usual rounds: He drove through the borderlands scoping out Taliban checkpoints. He stopped by one of his safe houses where 135 men sat hugging their knees on a dirt floor. Torn plastic from medicine tablets lay strewn around them and the smell of urine hung in the air.Stepping outside, he nodded at an old man smoking a cigarette who kept guard. Then H. turned to us. “This is enough, I think,” he said, suggesting it was time for us to go.Four days later, H. sent a photo of the boys, standing in front of a dust-covered orange tractor. They had made it into Iran that day."
"6","2022-03-10",NA,"I’ve never really understood readers who say they don’t like memoirs. For one thing, the genre theoretically comes closer than any other to granting us access to another mind on the page — the very reason so many readers turn to literature in the first place. For another, memoirs aren’t one thing: In subject and style and subjectivity, there are as many kinds of memoirs as there are kinds of writers. If you say you don’t like memoirs, you might as well say you don’t like books, or people.Around here, we like both. And we have lots of memoirs to recommend this week, with revealing looks at the lives of everyone from the first lady of Iceland to a reporter who went undercover with Afghan refugees to a woman who grew up with a pathologically deceptive mother. Amy Bloom’s “In Love” and Kathryn Davis’s “Aurelia, Aurélia” both grapple powerfully with the death of a spouse, and prove that memoirs can be wildly distinct even when they address the same topic. So too Meghan O’Rourke’s “The Invisible Kingdom” and Frank Bruni’s “The Beauty of Dusk,” which offer different takes on physical infirmity, and the far from formulaic show business memoirs “I Was Better Last Night” (by Harvey Fierstein) and “Run Towards the Danger” (by Sarah Polley). And just in case you really and truly hate memoirs, or are just in the mood for something else, we also recommend a couple of thrillers. Happy reading.Gregory CowlesSenior Editor, BooksTwitter: @GregoryCowlesIN LOVE: A Memoir of Love and Loss, by Amy Bloom. (Random House, $27.) This memoir by an acclaimed novelist is about her marriage with Brian Ameche, his diagnosis of Alzheimer’s and the couple’s search for a painless and dignified way for him to end his life. They discover that trying to die in America, in a rational and pain-free manner, isn’t easy at all. They end up turning to a Swiss nonprofit organization called Dignitas, where the process can be painless, peaceful and legal. “Bloom tells this story with grace and tact,” our critic Dwight Garner writes. “She doesn’t go overboard in explaining her moral reasoning. She doesn’t have to. Her title is her explanation.”AURELIA, AURÉLIA: A Memoir, by Kathryn Davis. (Graywolf, paper, $15.) Davis’s eight novels bear little relationship to anything that might be lassoed into the category of “contemporary fiction,” and “Aurelia, Aurélia” — her first work of nonfiction — is also an outlier. The central subject is the death of her husband, Eric, from cancer, but the book unfolds in time-shifting episodes that include scenes from Davis’s early childhood and adolescent years. It alights on Flaubert and Beethoven as well as on the knotty contradictions of grief. Our critic Molly Young writes: “‘Aurelia, Aurélia’ is only 108 pages long, and a mystery presents itself: How could so much consciousness be packed into such a small object?”I WAS BETTER LAST NIGHT: A Memoir, by Harvey Fierstein. (Knopf, $30.) In his memoir, the actor, writer and consummate New Yawker Fierstein looks back on growing up in the Bensonhurst neighborhood of Brooklyn, his earliest experiences with dress-up and make-believe (he now recognizes that he was a “7-year-old gender warrior”) and his smash successes in “Torch Song Trilogy” and “La Cage Aux Folles.” It’s a “warm and enveloping” memoir, our critic Alexandra Jacobs writes, with two sides to it: “One is a raw, cobwebby tale of anger, hurt, indignation and pain; flip it over and you get billowing ribbons of humor, gossip and fabulous, hot-pink success.”GIRL IN ICE, by Erica Ferencik. (Scout Press, $27.) Ferencik, who sets her thrillers in extreme landscapes, has placed this one at a climate research station in the Arctic Circle. There a little girl has been found frozen in the ice, very much alive, speaking an unknown language. As a linguist attempts to communicate with her, it becomes clear that nothing less than the fate of the earth may be at stake. “Like Peter Höeg’s ‘Smilla’s Sense of Snow’ and Ted Chiang’s ‘Story of Your Life,’ ‘Girl in Ice’ uses the subtleties of translation to draw us into different worlds and ways of thinking,” Sarah Lyall writes in her latest thrillers column. “It turns out that the word for ‘climate change’ in Inuktun, a language of northern Greenland, translates to ‘a friend acting strangely,’ which is sad and apt.”SECRET IDENTITY, by Alex Segura. (Flatiron, $27.99.) In this clever homage to classic noir — partly a love letter to New York City in the seamy 1970s, as well as an immersive tutorial in comic-book publishing of that era — a young woman investigates the murder of a colleague. “Witty and wholly original, the book is also surprisingly moving,” Sarah Lyall writes in her thrillers column. “It’s a delight to see Carmen push back against the casual sexism of the era.”THE INVISIBLE KINGDOM: Reimagining Chronic Illness, by Meghan O’Rourke. (Riverhead, $28.) For most of her 30s O’Rourke was terribly sick, with strange neurological spasms and abrupt agonizing sensations that sometimes confined her to bed for days on end; her memoir of the experience, in probing the links between illness and the self, becomes almost existential. O’Rourke deftly avoids both cynicism and romanticism, Andrew Solomon writes in his review, “achieving an authentically original voice and, perhaps more startlingly, an authentically original perspective. A poet by choice and an interpreter of medical doctrine by necessity, she brings an elegant discipline to her description of a horrific decade lost.”THE BEAUTY OF DUSK: On Vision Lost and Found, by Frank Bruni. (Avid Reader, $28.) In 2017, Bruni, a longtime editor, critic and columnist at this newspaper, had a stroke while sleeping and woke up to find he could not see well out of one eye. Determined not to let blindness leach the purpose or joy from his life, he began seeking the counsel of others who had faced similar physical declines. “What makes ‘The Beauty of Dusk’ far more remarkable than one man’s triumph over life’s cruelties is how Bruni persevered,” Min Jin Lee writes in her review. “This isn’t the sad story of a man who lost his sight; it is the generous narrative of a student who sought wisdom when trials appeared in his life.”NEVER SIMPLE: A Memoir, by Liz Scheier. (Holt, $26.99.) Scheier was raised on a steady diet of lies and entered adulthood unclear on basic facts about her own life. Eager to do better for her children, she decided to set the record straight. This powerful, conversational and — above all — honest memoir shakes hard truths out of the family tree. “The book reads like a Nancy Drew mystery where everyone’s favorite amateur sleuth has done intense personal work and now possesses the courage and the self-awareness to turn her magnifying glass inward,” Elisabeth Egan writes in her latest Group Text column.RUN TOWARDS THE DANGER: Confrontations With a Body of Memory, by Sarah Polley. (Penguin Press, $27.) In six candid essays, Polley — a filmmaker and former child star once known as “Canada’s sweetheart” — analyzes her early fame, her largely unsupervised adolescence and her complicated relationships. “The little girl who carried the weight of Hollywood movie budgets and theater actors’ salaries on her shoulders is now a grown woman whose stolen childhood has made her at once a stunningly sophisticated observer of the world and an imperfect witness to the truth,” Meghan Daum writes in her review. “Her willingness to embrace such paradoxes, in this book as well as in her films, is the mark of a real artist.”THE NAKED DON’T FEAR THE WATER: An Underground Journey With Afghan Refugees, by Matthieu Aikins. (Harper/HarperCollins, $27.99.) When Aikins, a Kabul-based journalist, set out with his translator on the perilous crossing between Afghanistan and Europe, he didn’t realize how it would change him. What started as an act of undercover journalistic brio grew, in the reviewer Jessica Goudeau’s words, into “an expansive, immersive work that reads like the most gripping novel but is all the more compelling because the events are both true and ongoing.”SECRETS OF THE SPRAKKAR: Iceland’s Extraordinary Women and How They Are Changing the World, by Eliza Reid. (Sourcebooks, $26.99.) For a dozen years, Iceland has outranked all countries in terms of gender equality. Reid, the Canadian-born first lady, explores why. “At its heart, Reid’s book is also a ‘love letter’ from an immigrant,” Cindi Leive writes in her review. “Like all love letters, it shines when it’s personal. The most vivid sense of Iceland’s unique approach to gender comes through Reid’s own experiences: How in her first job there, she walks by the conference room to see the board chair nursing a baby while running the meeting, no one batting an eyelash.”"
"7","2022-03-07","By Vivian Morelli","This interview is part of our latest Women and Leadership special report, which highlights women making significant contributions to the major stories unfolding in the world today. The conversation has been edited and condensed.Rumiko Seya, 45, is the president of REALs, a nonprofit organization based in Japan that since 1999 has focused on conflict prevention and peacekeeping in the Middle East, Africa and Asia.REALs (Reach Alternatives) provides services and assistance in a number of places, but lately is involved in Afghanistan, which has been experiencing violence and life-threatening food shortages since the Taliban took over last summer. What has been REALs’ role there? We have received more than 800 requests for evacuation. We try to reach out to the most vulnerable, but because everyone is at risk, we cannot save everyone at the same time. So we have to prioritize people, which is hard for us because I know everyone is facing some kind of life threat.What steps has REALs taken?As the charter evacuation flights have dramatically decreased since last September, we started securing other exit routes and providing protection. There are many pregnant women who can’t go to the hospital because they are afraid of being captured. So we send female doctors to their homes.At the same time, we secure visas to countries that can provide asylum or refugee status. That’s mainly in the U.S., Australia or Europe. So depending on the person, we have to select the countries for which they have a high success rate of being accepted, and we prepare all the documentation. If the families do not have financial resources, we raise funds and provide financial support for transportation and visa fees.Reporting From AfghanistanInside the Fall of Kabul: ​The Taliban took the Afghan capital with a speed that shocked the world. Our reporter and photographer witnessed it.On Patrol: A group of Times journalists spent 12 days with a Taliban police unit in Kabul. Here is what they saw.Face to Face: ​​A Times reporter who served as a Marine in Afghanistan returned to interview a Taliban commander he once fought.A Photographer’s Journal: A look at 20 years of war in Afghanistan, chronicled through one Times photographer’s lens.How many people have been evacuated so far?We managed to evacuate 184 [as of March 2]. We are in the process of evacuating 150 more. And we also have 400 to 500 people waiting for their cases to be processed.Has Japan welcomed Afghan refugees?The Japanese government evacuated around 500 people [as of March 2], but they were all [current] employees of the Japanese Embassy or the Japan International Cooperation Agency [a government agency that provides development assistance]. When they announced the evacuation of former staff, they only allowed the principal applicants to be evacuated. Since the main workers were fathers, most of them gave up being evacuated by Japan because they couldn’t leave their wives and children behind.Japan does not easily provide refugee status. The person or at least one family member has to have secured full employment or full educational positions in universities. If they meet these criteria, Japan will provide eligibility certification. But it’s not something we tell people in Afghanistan,  because they are about to be killed and then we have to tell them, ‘I know you used to work for Japan and thank you, but for you to be evacuated to Japan, you have to find full-time jobs.’ So we try to take people to other countries.We do collaborate with some companies in Japan that are ready to accept Afghans at risk. After we secure employment, we have to obtain all the documentation to apply for eligibility in Japan. That costs a lot and it takes time.  We are in the process of accepting two families through this process. One is going to Hokkaido and another one to Kumamoto. We are supporting 10 other families whose final destination is Japan. But among all the people that we are supporting, only about 10 percent come to Japan.Is REALs also focusing on women within Afghanistan?One of the women I support is 19 years old. She was working as a women’s activist and journalist, but she was threatened and assaulted by the Taliban because of her work. Still, she continues with pride. I had to take her out of Afghanistan to save her life. She still wants to go back to Afghanistan, if the situation improves. And there are many people like that. We also started food aid in Afghanistan in February, targeting 15,400 people, including women-headed households. Some of them are mothers, and some were university students who had a lot of dreams. But then it turned to darkness in one night.Where do the funds to support the evacuations and food aid come from?We receive U.N. and other support for other projects. But REALs does not receive any funding for Afghan evacuation, apart from private donations. We started fund-raising for that around October; before that, we used our internal assets. We need around $1 million to support the evacuations; so far about $300,000 has been donated to REALs.What made you decide to get into humanitarian work?When I was 17 years old, in high school, I saw a photo, taken in a refugee camp, in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where 2 million Rwandan people had fled. It was during a time when I was complaining a lot about my life. I realized there was only one camera between myself and the photo, but there was huge difference in life. I started having a vision of myself being able to return something to the people who enlightened me. I wanted to do something because I was saved by looking at these people.And now you are the president of this organization. Did you experience challenges as a woman during your career?In Afghanistan, I didn’t have a direct harassment, but I had to be careful. For example, during meetings with Afghan officials, I didn’t speak because I knew women are not supposed to speak in public. I was trying to be culturally sensitive.But there are also roles that only women can play. And that is the motivation for me to continue. When we work with women who were raped or attacked, they are afraid of talking to men even if they are from humanitarian organizations. But when I go there to talk to them, they open up."
"8","2022-02-28","By Alissa J. Rubin and Meridith Kohut","If you were leaving home forever and had just a few hours to collect your thoughts and most precious belongings, items that would have to fit into a knapsack or purse, or just your pockets, what would you choose?Tens of thousands of Afghans, the largest single influx of refugees to come to America since the end of the Vietnam War, faced that choice during the frantic dash to get out of their country last summer after the Taliban swept into Kabul, Afghanistan’s capital, unopposed.Whatever they chose — a piece of jewelry, perhaps, an old family photo — the objects now constitute their only tangible ties to the world they left behind.The same terrible choices that Afghans faced six months ago now confront the tens of thousands of Ukrainians similarly deciding to flee their homeland. Like the Afghans, they must make heart-wrenching decisions about what to carry with them — not knowing when or if they’ll return home.Most of those who left Afghanistan in August are now scattered across the United States, in 49 of the 50 states, in places as far-flung as Fargo, N.D., and Mobile, Ala. The New York Times asked Afghans settled in two regions, Northern Virginia and Houston, what they chose to bring in those hectic hours. Their responses tell a lot about who they are, the circumstances of their departure and their hopes for the future.One of them, Aria Rahmati, 25, worked right up to the moment the Taliban were poised to claim the presidential palace, where she was an assistant to President Ashraf Ghani, who unbeknown to her had already fled the country.As she picked up her purse and left the compound for the last time, she passed Taliban fighters on their way in. She decided not to go home, since she already was wearing the one thing she could not bear to leave behind: a sapphire and silver ring that had been given to her by a man she cared for.She went through three long days and several harrowing encounters with the Taliban at Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul before she reached the area controlled by the U.S. military. It took quite a bit longer to reach Leesburg, Va., where she has now resettled. As for the ring, Ms. Rahmati hopes the man who gave it to her will still care for her when she sees him again. When two people are separated, “everything changes,” she said. “But I have not taken it off my finger since it was given to me.”The 13 families interviewed for this article, of whom six are described here, provide a cross section of their former land. Yet, they share one quality that got them through the chaos of those final days and ultimately onto flights to the United States: a flinty determination, often mixed with desperation for their own safety and that of their families.In the words of a beautician who made it through and is now living in Houston: “I just kept going forward.”Nangialay Pashai: A KnapsackFor 17 years, Nangialay Pashai’s work for the American and Afghan security forces in the eastern city of Jalalabad defined his existence, first as a U.S. military contractor and then as a soldier in the Afghan army. So last summer, when he fled to escape vengeful Taliban fighters, the one thing he could not bear to leave behind was his army rucksack.The Afghan soldiers were ordered to leave everything behind and change into civilian clothes, to blend in safely with the crowd. Those like Mr. Pashai, 36, who had applied for Special Immigration Visas to the United States, would be flown to Kabul, where they would meet up with their families.Reporting From AfghanistanInside the Fall of Kabul: ​The Taliban took the Afghan capital with a speed that shocked the world. Our reporter and photographer witnessed it.On Patrol: A group of Times journalists spent 12 days with a Taliban police unit in Kabul. Here is what they saw.Face to Face: ​​A Times reporter who served as a Marine in Afghanistan returned to interview a Taliban commander he once fought.A Photographer’s Journal: A look at 20 years of war in Afghanistan, chronicled through one Times photographer’s lens.After reluctantly unlacing his military boots, taking off his army issue pants and T-shirt and leaving his guns and ammo belt, he looked at the knapsack.“We had been together a long time,” he said.When he reached Kabul, the mostly empty knapsack slung over his shoulder, he was surprised to see some merchants still selling camo pants and regulation-style, brown army T-shirts. On an impulse, he bought one of each and stuffed them into the knapsack to bring along as tokens of his past military life.Sitting with his wife, Nasrine, in their small, bare apartment in Houston in December as dusk fell, with his six children running around, he opened the knapsack and at the bottom found an unopened M.R.E. (Meal, Ready-to-Eat), the soldier’s food staple.He smiled ruefully and said, “This bag is my friend.”Yalda Royan: A QuranAs a single mother and women’s rights activist raising her children in Kabul, Yalda Royan, 42, knew she was a marked woman, having received death threats over the years.She had held her head high through a difficult marriage, through her husband going to prison and, when he got out, his decision to live far away in northern Afghanistan and then a divorce.But as the Taliban advanced on Kabul, Ms. Royan thought also of her daughters. She worried she would not be able to protect them from forced marriages or, even worse, being trafficked. Seeing no choice but to flee, she warned her girls to pack only the barest necessities, so that the Taliban would find nothing suspicious in the event they were searched on their way to the airport.“I burned all my documents, English or Dari,” she said, her eyes brimming. “They were certificates, contracts that I had brought home to review, my notebooks from focus group discussions. That was not easy.”The girls mostly complied, until Bahara, 16, refused to leave without the family’s pocket-size, travel Quran.The book, which now sits on a small table in their sparsely furnished living room in Ashburn, Va., would be the lone memento of their lives in Afghanistan.Through the bedlam at the airport, Ms. Royan said, “Bahara held the Quran in her arms for eight hours, maybe more. Even when there was shooting, she held it.”“I thought it would protect us,” said Bahara.Bakhtullah Noor Wali: A TattooBakhtullah Noor Wali, 16, grew up in a post-Taliban Afghanistan, where it seemed normal to him to listen to contemporary Asian music, use a computer and, like his older brothers, get a tattoo — which would be considered blasphemous by the Taliban.So a couple of years ago, when he had his and his girlfriend’s initials tattooed on his hand, he was pleased: the tattoo impressed his girlfriend, Amina, and he envisioned them getting married, the way teenagers in love often do.Then, in August, the Taliban came to his hometown, Khost, just over the border from Pakistan. One of his brothers, who had worked as an interpreter for the Americans and had already moved to the United States, called with an urgent message: Get to the Kabul airport as soon as you can. He feared his family would be branded as collaborators because of his work.That’s when Mr. Wali realized the tattoo could be a problem if the Taliban discovered it at one of the many checkpoints on the road to Kabul. “The Taliban will take the tattoos off with acid, and if they do not have acid, they do it with a knife,” he said.It was too late to have it removed, so he and another brother, Lal Mohammed, who also had a tattoo, hatched a plan. They covered their tattoos with large band-aids and wore gloves and shalwar kameez, the traditional Afghan long-sleeved tunic and long pants.They made it through the checkpoints and through the thousands clambering at the gates of Kabul airport. Now, in Houston with several family members, Mr. Wali longs for Amina and stays up late every night talking to her on WhatsApp, promising to bring her to America.Tahera Ahmadi: A Butterfly PinWhen the Taliban reached the gates of the western city of Herat last summer, Tahera Ahmadi, 33, a doctor who was working for an American firm, Development Alternatives Incorporated, knew she had to leave. Not only was she a member of the Hazara ethnic group, Shiite Muslims who the Taliban regard as apostates, she was a woman living alone, her husband having already moved to the United States.But she needed cash to pay for a plane ticket to Kabul, on the other side of the country — the only place she stood a chance of getting a flight out. Parting with her computer and iPhone was hard, but they were replaceable. Then, the only thing left was her jewelry. By the time she reached America, there were only a few pieces left. “I was not the type of girl who was into wearing jewelry, but my sisters told me that I would need it for difficult days,” Ms. Ahmadi said. “They were right.”First to go was a piece of gold given to her by her eldest sister, who had been like a mother to her when she was growing up. Next went the pendant and bracelets Ms. Ahmadi had worn on her wedding day and then, more painfully, her gold wedding ring.She made enough money from selling her jewelry not only to get herself to Kabul, but also to pay the way for her best friend, Zarah, but by then there were no embassies open. Friends warned Ms. Ahmadi against going to the airport; the crowds at the gate were impossible to get through and women could not travel alone because the Taliban prohibited it, they said.Undeterred, Ms. Ahmadi decided to sell some of the last pieces of jewelry she owned to pay the $80 she and Zarah would need for a taxi to the airport, and back if they failed to get on a flight. A jeweler bought one of the pieces, but when he saw tears welling in her eyes he refused to buy the other: a pin made of blue fabric in the shape of a butterfly with a smaller, paper-thin gold butterfly at its center. It had also been a gift from her eldest sister.“My sister told me the butterfly stands for revolution,” she said.Revolution, as in not accepting what the authorities tell you. Ms. Ahmadi told Zarah when they got to the airport, “If the guards say go back, we don’t move.” They made it through the airport gates and on to America.The butterfly pin is with Ms. Ahmadi now in Northern Virginia, a reminder of all it took to get there, but also a promise that she will summon herself for the next chapter.Mohammad Taqi Nizami: A SmartphoneAs a squadron commander in the Afghan Air Force, Mohammad Taqi Nizami became an expert at loading bombs onto the planes that targeted Taliban fighters, and gained the respect of the U.S. Air Force’s military advisers.On Aug. 15, the day the Taliban marched into Kabul, his expertise became a liability. He left the air base where he worked wearing civilian clothes, worried about being arrested, if not executed, at the hands of vengeful Taliban patrols.Mr. Nizami, 31, knew that if he could get out of Afghanistan with his life and his wife, he would be lucky.“I didn’t know what to do,” he said.Armed only with his cellphone — a beat-up, white Apple 6 Plus — he started to make calls. Some 40 calls later, someone put him in touch with Operation Sacred Promise, a group of American veterans helping Afghan airmen who, like Mr. Nizami, had not worked directly for the Americans and did not qualify for a Special Immigration Visa. They offered to help, but there was a catch: He would have to bring documents to the airport to prove his service background.How, he wondered, could he get the certificates and service awards he had received safely through Taliban checkpoints?“I kept thinking about my phone,” he said, but he was worried that if the Taliban saw the photos on it of him in his military uniform, it would give him away. Then he hit on a plan. “I scanned everything into it and then ran down the battery, so if someone at a checkpoint tried to turn it on, they couldn’t,” he said. He hid the phone under his clothes and was lucky, no one searched him because he appeared not to be carrying anything.It was the only thing Mr. Nizami brought from home, but it held a record of his life.His phone is now his lifeline as he starts again in Herndon, Va. When he feels homesick, he picks it up to look at family photos, but it also holds the documents he hopes will make his case to stay in America.Maliha Karimi: Her NephewThe week the Taliban took over Kabul, with the city awash with talk of Taliban restrictions on women and education, the extended Karimi family, all 36 of them spread over three generations, decided on the spur of the moment to flee.Neither Maliha Karimi nor most of her family members had ever been on a plane or even inside the Kabul airport, but the idea of leaving gathered momentum, and they set off for the airport.“I just took my passport and one phone,” she recalled, “We had no food, no water.”Ms. Karimi, 27, the sole breadwinner for her parents and one disabled brother and his family of six, had a special reason to get out. As a beautician, she had lost her job the moment the Taliban returned, because they banned beauty salons as immoral, making it impossible for her to care for her family.“They thought they were brothels,” she said.The Karimi family reached the airport at 6 a.m. “The crowds were terrible, pushing and shouting, and the Taliban were shooting in the air,” Ms. Karimi said.In the chaos, the family became separated. Ms. Karimi grabbed the hand of one of her brother’s children, 6-year-old Sorush, while a cousin, Soraya, took the boy’s other hand. Keeping their heads down, they fought their way toward the gate.“I just decided to go forward, not backward,” she said. “I just kept going forward.”Suddenly, the two young women, with Sorush between them, were swept through the gate. The other 33 family members were left behind, but there was no turning back.It was four full days before they reached Fort Bliss in El Paso, where Ms. Karimi finally could access Wi-Fi and call Kabul to speak with the anguished parents of Sorush, who was so upset he had stopped eating. Everyone wept: the parents aching for their son and Sorush homesick for his family.With Ms. Karimi gone and no one in her family back in Afghanistan working, they are short of everything: food, heating oil and medicines and are begging Ms. Karimi for help.She got $200 from a Muslim aid organization, An Nisa Hope Center in Houston, which she was supposed to use for clothes, food and medicine for herself and Sorush, but she wired it all to her brother in Kabul.Sorush is what Ms. Karimi carried with her, and the bonds between them are now not only of blood but of forging a new life, despite the anguish and demands of the family they left behind."
"9","2022-02-16","By Miriam Jordan","LOS ANGELES — As a combat interpreter in Afghanistan, Sharif Azizi helped U.S. Special Forces hunt down Taliban targets, even after suffering leg and chest injuries from stepping on a land mine. When his life was threatened by the insurgents, the United States acknowledged his eight years of service and in 2017 brought him to safety in Los Angeles.Last year, when Taliban fighters seized Kabul, they came looking for his mother and siblings. Unable to make it through the throngs amassed at the airport as the last American flights were leaving, the family fled to Pakistan. U.S. security officials who had helped arrange their exit papers assured the family that it could apply for a program designed to expedite entry into the United States for people facing emergencies. Months after submitting their applications, they received the response from the U.S. government: Denied.“All the certificates of commendation I received, all the promises we got, it feels like a big lie,” said Mr. Azizi, who currently lives in San Jose, Calif. “They just leave my family and basically say, ‘That’s done. We don’t care.’”Thousands of Afghan allies who narrowly missed being evacuated, and who have been living in hiding in Afghanistan or illegally in neighboring countries, have counted on a program known as humanitarian parole to reach the United States. But half a year since the frantic U.S. withdrawal, most remain stranded, either because they have been denied entry or are still awaiting the outcome of their cases.Of the 43,000 humanitarian parole applications the agency has received since July 2021, it has processed fewer than 2,000. About 1,500 had been denied and 170 approved as of Feb. 11.The Department of Homeland Security uses parole authority to allow certain people or groups to legally enter the United States without a visa, which can take months or years to process. It has been utilized in the past to provide safe passage for large numbers of people out of conflict zones where the United States had military involvement, such as Vietnam and Iraq, as well for others in vulnerable situations, including Cubans and Central American minors.After the hurried pullout from Afghanistan, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services agency received an avalanche of applications from Afghans who had not managed to board an evacuation flight. But only one out of eight whose cases have been adjudicated thus far has won approval, raising questions about how many people will be admitted and whether the program was ever a realistic option.“The primary difference between these people and all the people who the U.S. airlifted is that these people were not able to shove their way through the crowds at the airport,” said Kyra Lilien, director of immigration legal services at Jewish Family & Community Services East Bay, a nonprofit in Concord, Calif., that is resettling Afghan refugees.The agency has collected millions of dollars from applicants who pay a $575 fee to file, but processing has been sluggish, leading to frustration and worry.Reporting From AfghanistanInside the Fall of Kabul: ​The Taliban took the Afghan capital with a speed that shocked the world. Our reporter and photographer witnessed it.On Patrol: A group of Times journalists spent 12 days with a Taliban police unit in Kabul. Here is what they saw.Face to Face: ​​A Times reporter who served as a Marine in Afghanistan returned to interview a Taliban commander he once fought.A Photographer’s Journal: A look at 20 years of war in Afghanistan, chronicled through one Times photographer’s lens.“This was supposed to be a flexible mechanism for Afghans who supported the U.S. mission and have provided ample proof of danger to their lives,” said Steve Brozak, 60, a retired lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Marine Corps who hired an immigration law firm to prepare the applications for the Azizi family.The agency said it had increased fivefold the number of adjudicators reviewing applications, given the surge in filings. Before the Afghan crisis, about 2,000 people a year applied for humanitarian parole, and 500 to 700 were approved, often for urgent medical treatment or to visit a dying relative.“Humanitarian parole is not intended to replace established refugee processing channels such as the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program, which is the typical pathway for individuals outside of the United States who have fled their country of origin and are seeking protection,” the agency said in a statement.Under the refugee program, it takes several years for people to be admitted to the United States. It also takes many years for legal U.S. residents, like Mr. Azizi, to sponsor their families for admission.For many of those waiting for emergency approvals, an association with the U.S. mission has made it impossible for them to remain at their homes in Afghanistan; they are either in hiding or are living illegally in other countries, in danger of being sent back.“The refugee resettlement program is overwhelmed and lacks resources because of all the cuts the prior administration made,” said Steve Yale-Loehr, an immigration law professor at Cornell Law School who directs an Afghan law clinic that has filed dozens of parole applications, none approved so far.In the statement by Citizenship and Immigration Services, it said the agency had been granting parole when warranted. “In some limited circumstances, protection needs are so urgent that obtaining protection via the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program is not a realistic option,” it said.The bar for qualifying is very high as the government tries to determine which applicants are in genuine imminent danger and which could wait to apply for ordinary refugee status. Applicants must provide documentation from a credible third-party source that specifically names the targeted person and details the potential harm that person faces. Lawyers helping applicants file the claims said the standard was higher than what is generally applied to parole applicants and would be very difficult for most people fleeing a country in conflict to meet.“This criteria makes it nearly impossible for the vast majority of cases to be granted,” said Ms. Lilien, who has received 13 denials on the applications she has submitted and is waiting for decisions on an additional 78, almost all of which were filed before mid-September.A letter sent on Tuesday to the Homeland Security secretary, Alejandro Mayorkas, and signed by more than 200 representatives of legal-service providers, resettlement agencies and university law clinics called on the Biden administration to establish a streamlined, efficient system to bring vulnerable Afghans to the United States.“While the military evacuation efforts ended with the withdrawal of U.S. troops in August 2021, at-risk Afghans’ dire need for protection has not,” the letter said.“In keeping with its promises, the administration must act with urgency to utilize all tools at its disposal, including parole, to provide protection from persecution and violence in Afghanistan due to the accelerating human rights and humanitarian crisis,” the letter said, citing extrajudicial killings, disappearances and other human rights abuses.It pointed out that after the fall of Saigon, the United States established a parole program to swiftly evacuate more than 140,000 Vietnamese refugees.A majority of the 76,000 Afghans evacuated during the U.S. pullout were admitted on arrival with humanitarian parole, many of them people who might also have qualified for special immigrant visas issued to people who had worked directly for the U.S. forces, like Mr. Azizi, or for refugee status after performing jobs that advanced the goals of the U.S. mission.Mr. Azizi said the Taliban had come searching for his family members after they abandoned their home. Soldiers had questioned the neighbors about their whereabouts and left a notice that ordered the family to report to Taliban headquarters upon its return, he said.Mr. Azizi’s mother, Sima Barakzai, had been employed as a U.S. contractor as a cook, according to documents she submitted as part of her application. His sister, Sharareh, was trained and recognized by the U.S. Agency for International Development for her work to promote women’s rights, and her parole application, also reviewed by The Times, included a photograph of her shaking hands with Ashraf Ghani, the former Afghan president.In all, four family members had been issued an exit pass by U.S. military authorities in Afghanistan that entitled them to board U.S. evacuation flights, but they were unable to get through the gates at the airport in Kabul before the last flights departed.As weeks turned into months without any decision on their applications, Mr. Brozak, the retired military officer who was aiding them, enlisted the help of Senator Bob Menendez of New Jersey, who personally reached out to the Homeland Security Department, which oversees Citizenship and Immigration Services, on the family’s behalf. To no avail.On Jan. 27, the family members were dismayed to receive denial letters. A form letter, which did not address the particulars of their cases, stated that parole was granted to people “at risk of severe targeted or individualized harm” in the country where they were located, or who risked imminent return to a country where they would be harmed.In Pakistan, they are leading a precarious existence, unable to work to support themselves and trying to stay under the radar because of their illegal status. They have had to move four times.During an outing to buy food recently, Mr. Azizi’s 19-year-old brother was beaten up by people demanding bribes to refrain from reporting the family to authorities.Mr. Azizi, who has been working as an Uber driver while taking computer science classes, said he had put his life in California on hold as he devoted himself to assisting his family.“My heart is in so much pain. What will life be worth for me if I lose a member of my family?” said Mr. Azizi, weeping during an interview.“I participated in big military operations. I risked my life for this country,” he said. “But it just abandoned my family.”"
"10","2022-02-15","By Jessica Goudeau","THE NAKED DON’T FEAR THE WATERAn Underground Journey With Afghan RefugeesBy Matthieu AikinsSince the first allied attack on the Taliban in October 2001 began what many consider the longest war in U.S. history, few foreign journalists have written about Afghanistan with the depth and doggedness of the Kabul-based Canadian journalist Matthieu Aikins. His first book, “The Naked Don’t Fear the Water: An Underground Journey With Afghan Refugees,” follows his friend and longtime translator Omar (who, like most of the Afghans portrayed in the book, uses a pseudonym) as he flees economic uncertainty and political instability to find a new life in Europe. The journey took place in 2016 — but after Kabul fell to the Taliban last year and the U.S. withdrawal forced tens of thousands of Afghans to flee the country, the book feels prescient. Aikins poignantly frames the question many of us have been wrestling with since the chaotic events of 2021: “What does it mean to be free in our world? The refugee is freedom’s negative image; she illustrates the story of progress that we tell ourselves.”It has become a cliché to state that a book is “urgent” or “necessary” when it touches on a critical humanitarian issue; almost any book about Afghan migrants would be important right now. But this book is exceptionally well done. That’s primarily due to Aikins’s painstaking, unflinching portrayals. In refusing to make saints or sinners of ordinary people caught up in extraordinary circumstances, Aikins crafts an expansive, immersive work that reads like the most gripping novel but is all the more compelling because the events are both true and ongoing.At the heart of the book is Aikins’s relationship with Omar, who worked closely with him for years as a translator in some of the most volatile situations in Afghanistan. In leaving his country, Omar is driven by his love for a woman named Laila, whose Shia father — his landlord — will not consider a marriage proposal from his Sunni tenant unless he can vastly improve his prospects. When Omar’s plan to emigrate to the United States through the Special Immigrant Visa program is dashed, he is faced with what Aikins calls “the smuggler’s road to Europe, a long and dangerous journey across the mountains and sea.” When Omar leaves, Aikins goes with him to document the crossing.Going deep undercover, Aikins disguises himself as a fellow migrant with the name “Habib.” The back story he creates — born in Kabul, but Malaysian-raised — helps explain Aikins’s slightly foreign accent when speaking Dari; and as the son of a Japanese American mother and a Scottish Canadian father, he is often mistaken for someone from northern Afghanistan. But even after he leaves his passport with a friend, Aikins never forgets that his citizenship opens doors his fellow migrants cannot access. He grapples with the ethics of choice on a journey that only a journalist would choose, and with the impossibility of maintaining impartiality when he is living among the people he’s writing about and becoming a part of the story. This is especially true when they cram into an overpacked dinghy on a tumultuous sea; Aikins, a strong swimmer, makes sure Omar has the last life jacket and mentally prepares for how to help if the boat sinks.During a journey as haphazard as it is harrowing, Aikins keeps the focus on Omar and the other migrants while giving enough context that we always understand what’s at stake in this high-risk, ever-shifting environment. At times, especially toward the end, the pacing of the book is electrifying. But this is no “Sound of Music” finale. Instead Omar, Aikins and their fellow migrants climb mountains, only to realize they have to go back and find another way. They are apprehended by officials and released, then caught again. At the last minute, a smuggler hustles them onto a boat bound for the very part of Europe they had hoped to avoid, leading to a prolonged period of confinement in one of the worst detention encampments in the European Union. There are no tidy arcs or pat resolutions. Aikins chronicles it all, typing up his notes on his phone nightly, until eventually he has logged more than 60,000 words.Small vignettes tell a larger story. A Greek man yells at the Afghan migrants for swimming in the ocean, then apologizes: “Tell them it’s nothing personal. … We’re both stuck in the middle of something much bigger than us.” Wealthy nations, Aikins implies, love feel-good moments — holding up signs that say “Refugees welcome here!” or awarding humanitarian prizes — but are less interested in the hard work of studying the underlying causes of mass migration from war-torn and economically ravaged countries. Instead, that work falls too often to individuals or small groups who cannot possibly address the scale of the crisis. The swelling waves of people are barely contained by the border camp where Aikins and Omar get stuck, or in the squats and underground hiding places where they stay along the way: “From this dammed-up pool of the displaced, the West takes measured sips.”Aikins does not just criticize governments; he examines his biases in a way that invites readers to scrutinize their own. He finds Omar’s almost obsessive feelings for Laila alternately inspiring and frustrating: “There was no logic to love.” Before the trip, he spends months trying to persuade his friend to leave Afghanistan, but Omar lingers, hoping for some word from Laila. Months into their journey, Omar sinks into a depression, listening obsessively to Celine Dion and searching Facebook for mentions of Laila (who isn’t on social media). Aikins feels “a prick of annoyance” at the hours Omar spends staring at his phone: “What kind of protagonist was he?” Aikins had hoped to write about “someone who spoke English and understood Europe, who marched with the activists and made love to volunteers, a real hero.” But Aikins uses this scene, among others, to shine a glaring light on his own unfair expectations; Omar is not a stock character — the revolutionary hero calculated to rally Western sympathy — but his friend, sad and homesick. Aikins ensures that, to the breathless end, we are rooting for Omar and the world he hopes to create for the love of his life.On this journey, Aikins finds love too, though of a different kind. When he cups a child’s head while their boat flails through riotous waves, when he dances with new friends at an unlikely haven in Athens, when he shares a sandwich with a man who is more brother than friend, Aikins moves past his role as journalist. He experiences the kind of equality that politicians, advocates and religious leaders tout but rarely achieve. Aikins wants to believe in some activists’ vision of a world where transformative, systemic, societal change is possible: “To believe felt like falling in love.” Instead, he discovers that this ideal can be found only “in fragments.” He weaves those fragments into a meticulously told story the world needs to hear now more than ever.This book is Aikins’s profound act of love — for Omar, for their travel companions and for the beleaguered people of Afghanistan, now irrevocably scattered around the world."
